# Bulldozers -- Predict the auction price

This project is to create a ML model that predicts the sale price of a particular piece of heavy equipment at the auction using the given features in the Train.csv on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data). The actual sale price of the heavy equipment is also given in the data set in the variable named  `SalePrice`.

The data was collected by a business known as [Fast Iron](https://www.fastiron.com) and then a modelling competition was hosted by the Fast Iron on the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com).

We will use the following python libraries to process and model the data:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `sklearn`
